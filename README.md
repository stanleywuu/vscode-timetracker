## Why do I want to try it
Tracking time helps you by:
* Keeping you focused on a single task
* Providing a trail of work habit
* Generating a report for your standup meetings
## Known Issues
* Records are global, which means they are not workspace specific
* Currently there is no roll over, the log file grows indefinitely
